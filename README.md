**Mobile Price Range Classifier using Machine Learning**

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Google Colab, Scikit-learn

Description:
Developed a machine learning model to classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on technical specifications. Performed data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering on the dataset. Applied supervised learning techniques to train and evaluate the model.

Key Contributions:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and handle missing values and duplicates.

Visualized feature distributions and categorical relationships using advanced tools like Seaborn and Plotly.

Engineered features to improve model accuracy and trained multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

Outcome:
Achieved reliable classification performance and insights into the key factors affecting mobile pricing.
